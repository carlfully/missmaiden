# Missmaiden
A very kind CLI program made in C++ that opens up programs for you!

Made in C++, missmaiden (very creative name) manages to open up applications faster than I could do! I know this may sound useless, but once I manage to make it open more apps at once will show how good of a time-saver will be!

## Features
- it opens apps, also it's based on what you code in: in my case it can open [Kew](kew), Zen, Vesktop or Steam.
- "highly customizable": being a single .cpp file means if you paid attention to IT class you *should* be able to to small changes to that it can open your apps
- Has **4** lines of text, which change based on given commands! (pretty cool, eh)
### - soon-to-come features
- open more than one app at a time
- have a nicer "UI"
- make the code look like it wasn't written by a 7-year Blizzard employee
